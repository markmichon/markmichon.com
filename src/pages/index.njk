  # Mark Michon
  ## Let's build a better web.
  I'm a technical writer, former educator, occasional developer, and erstwhile designer. I care deeply about approachable design, accessible information, and the power of the open web.

  Previously, I managed documentation and technical content at [Bearer](https://www.bearer.com), taught development and design at [Full Sail University](https://fullsail.edu), and built courses for [Designlab](https://trydesignlab.com).

  I'm looking for opportunities working on product and developer documentation. [Here's how I can help your team](/hire).
