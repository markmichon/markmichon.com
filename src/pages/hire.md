Hi there, I'm Mark :wave:.

I'm a technical writer and editor that works with companies of all sizes. Below you'll find some areas where I can help, and examples to give you a better idea of the work I do. If anything sounds like something your company needs help with, [get in touch](mailto:hello@markmichon.com).

## Product and developer documentation

Great docs make the difference between good and great tools, and poor documentation can slow adoption.

Whether as a permanent member of your team or merely dropping in for big releases, I can help craft accessible, informative, and clear documentation.

I can assist in:

- Building out docs from scratch.
- Audit and rework existing documentation to improve the information architecture, improve clarity, and help with future organization.
- Helping to select a docs-as-code platform, or build one to suit a team's specific goals.
- Develop a style guide that hits the right balance so your developers aren't blocked by overly noisy warnings.

The following describes my approach to documentation projects:

- [Bearer CLI case study and retrospective](/bearer-cli-case-study/)

## Technical writing and editing

Technical explainers, tutorials, and guides are a great way to add content to your site, blog, or docs. Keyword-rich SEO may bring traffic, but educational content that solves real customer needs converts visitors into customers.

Some examples of the kinds of developer content I can write can be found on the [articles page](/articles) of this site, or in the links below:

- [How Bearer CLI works](https://docs.bearer.com/explanations/workflow/)
- [Building a circuit breaker in Node.js](https://dev.to/bearer/building-a-circuit-breaker-in-node-js-part-1-2e98)
- [What is an API gateway?](https://dev.to/bearer/what-is-an-api-gateway-42i6)

## Developer writing programs

Interested in making it easier for engineers to write for your company blog? I can help launch writing initiatives for your team, act as an editor, and transform drafts and ideas into valuable blog posts. If you're struggling with culture-fit and attracting passionate team members, don't slack on your team's blog.
