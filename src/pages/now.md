Welcome to `markmichon/now`. Here's what I'm up to lately. This page in inspired by [the /now movement](https://nownownow.com/about). If you see something of interest here, let me know on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@markmichon).

## Work

I joined [Sanity](https://sanity.io) in late August. I've been onboarding and working on ways to improve the docs.

## Projects

Building **Texture**, a site for my writing about travel, cities, and subjects further adrift from code.

## Portland

We're approaching five years(!) in Portland. After this summer's constant barrage of storms in the southeastern US, we're relieved. I'll write more about Portland, how we chose it, and a retrospective in the coming month.
