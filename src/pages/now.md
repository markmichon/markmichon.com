## Work?

I'm actively looking for a new technical writing role! Head over to the [Hire me](/hire/) page for details, or get in touch on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmichon/) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@markmichon).

## Projects

- This site, the one you're reading, is *finally* seeing some updates. I'm building out new features and writing about them. More to come.
- Adding features and styling to ðŸ‘‹ *(Wave)*, my bespoke little privacy-first analytics app.
- Building **Texture**, a site for my writing about travel, cities, and subjects further adrift from code.

## Portland

- After a year in a cool, dark place, last year's batch of [umeshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umeshu) is finally complete.
- Our kitchen is in peak fermentation mode. Aside from the usual tub of kimchi in the fridge, the pantry has an assortment of in-progress concoctions like [makgeolli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makgeolli), mustard, and ginger beer on heavy-rotation.
