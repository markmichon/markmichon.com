## Projects

- Building **Texture**, a site for my writing about travel, cities, and subjects further adrift from code.
- Iterating on a Coffee roasting management app, built on [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io).
- Slowly migrating sites and projects to my VPS. There's a few small pieces still living on Vercel or Netlify, but it's nice to have a bit more control and learn a bit along the way.
